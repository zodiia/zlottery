# Lottery

**WARNING:** This is an old, undocumented project. It is however in a production-ready state, at least for Minecraft 1.17-1.19.

This is a lottery plugin, where players are able to participate in lotteries by buying tickets. The winning ticket is then randomly selected, and the winner gets the money.
